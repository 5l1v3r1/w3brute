# Contributing to w3brute

## Reporting bugs

**Bug reports are welcome**!
Please report all bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/aprilahijriyan/w3brute/issues).

### Guidelines

* Before you submit a bug report, search both [open](https://github.com/aprilahijriyan/w3brute/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) and [closed](https://github.com/aprilahijriyan/w3brute/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues to make sure the issue has not come up before.
* Make sure you can reproduce the bug with the latest development version of w3brute.
* Your report should give detailed instructions on how to reproduce the problem. If w3brute raises an unhandled exception, the entire traceback is needed. Details of the unexpected behaviour are welcome too. A small test case (just a few lines) is ideal.

## Submitting code changes

All code contributions are greatly **appreciated**.
**NOTE**: Do not touch anything inside `thirdparty/` folder.

### Guidelines

* First, you must clone the [Git repository](https://github.com/aprilahijriyan/w3brute).
